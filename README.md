## Task 1 — Dataset Analysis & Visualization

### Selected Dataset
- **Name**: Video Game Sales Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogame-sales) and [GitHub Mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/vgsales.csv)
- **Size**: ~16,500 rows × 11 columns
- **Description**: Contains information about video game sales across different regions including North America, Europe, Japan, and other areas.

### Dataset Columns
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Rank | Ranking of overall sales |
| Name | Name of the game |
| Platform | Platform of the game release (Wii, PS4, X360, etc.) |
| Year | Year the game was released |
| Genre | Genre of the game |
| Publisher | Publisher of the game |
| NA_Sales | Sales in North America (in millions) |
| EU_Sales | Sales in Europe (in millions) |
| JP_Sales | Sales in Japan (in millions) |
| Other_Sales | Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) |
| Global_Sales | Total worldwide sales (in millions) |

### Data Quality Issues Found
1. **Missing Values**: Year column has ~271 missing values, Publisher column has ~58 missing values
2. **Duplicates**: Some games appear multiple times across different platforms
3. **Inconsistent Data**: Some year values are float instead of integer
4. **Outliers**: Some games have extremely high sales compared to the majority
5. **Data Types**: Year needs conversion from float to integer

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Loaded raw dataset and inspected structure
2. Identified and documented all quality issues
3. Handled missing values (dropped rows with missing Year/Publisher)
4. Removed exact duplicate rows
5. Converted Year from float to integer
6. Standardized text formatting for Genre and Platform columns
7. Treated outliers using IQR method
8. Created new features (Decade, Sales_Category, Total_Regional_Sales)
9. Renamed columns for clarity
10. Saved cleaned dataset

### 15 Analysis Questions

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | What is the overall distribution of global video game sales? |
| 2 | Which game genre has the most titles in the dataset? |
| 3 | What are the top 10 best-selling video games of all time? |
| 4 | How have global video game sales changed over the years? |
| 5 | Which gaming platform has the highest total global sales? |
| 6 | What is the market share of each sales region? |

## Task 2 — Web Scraping & Domain Analysis

### Selected Domain
- **Domain**: Books & Publishing
- **Target Website**: [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com)
- **Why This Domain**: The books domain provides rich data about pricing, categories, and ratings that is easy to understand and analyze.

### Scraping Details
- **Total Pages Scraped**: 50 pages (20 books per page)
- **Total Books Scraped**: 1,000 books
- **Data Fields**: Title, Price, Rating (1-5 stars), Category, Availability, Book URL
- **Library Used**: requests + BeautifulSoup + lxml

### Scraping Workflow
1. Started from the main catalog page
2. Identified the URL pattern for pagination: `catalogue/page-{n}.html`
3. Looped through all 50 pages
4. Extracted book data from each page using CSS selectors
5. Converted text ratings (One, Two, etc.) to numeric (1-5)
6. Cleaned price strings by removing the £ symbol
7. Built a structured DataFrame from collected data
8. Saved to CSV for reuse

### 5 Analysis Questions

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | What is the distribution of book prices across the catalog? |
| 2 | Which book categories have the most titles? |
| 3 | Is there a relationship between book price and rating? |
| 4 | Which categories have the highest and lowest average prices? |
| 5 | What is the distribution of book ratings across all books? |

### Key Insights
- Book prices range from **£10** to **£60** with most books priced between **£15-35**
- **Default** category has the most books (since some books are not categorized)
- There is **no strong correlation** between price and rating — expensive books are not always better rated
- **Suspense** and **Historical Fiction** categories tend to have higher average prices
- The **majority of books** have a 4 or 5 star rating, suggesting rating inflation or selection bias

## Task 3 — Machine Learning Regression

### Problem Statement
Predict the global sales of a video game based on its characteristics (platform, genre, publisher, year) using machine learning regression models.

### Models Trained
| # | Model | Type |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | Linear Regression | Linear |
| 2 | Decision Tree Regressor | Tree |
| 3 | Random Forest Regressor | Ensemble |
| 4 | Gradient Boosting Regressor | Boosting |
| 5 | Extra Trees Regressor | Ensemble |
| 6 | XGBoost Regressor | Boosting |

### Features Used
- **Platform_Encoded** — Which console the game is on
- **Genre_Encoded** — What type of game it is
- **Publisher_Encoded** — Who published the game
- **Year** — When the game was released
- **Is_Top_Publisher** — Binary flag (engineered)
- **Platform_Age** — Years since platform launch (engineered)
- **Genre_Frequency** — How common the genre is (engineered)
- **Decade** — Decade of release (engineered)

### Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- 5-Fold Cross-Validation

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Applied RandomizedSearchCV on Gradient Boosting
- 50 parameter combinations with 5-fold CV
- Optimized for R² score

### Key Insights
- Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) significantly outperform Linear Regression
- Publisher and Genre are the strongest predictors of game sales
- The models predict average-selling games well but struggle with blockbuster outliers
- Feature engineering improved model performance marginally

## Run Instructions

### Running the Jupyter Notebooks

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Then open:
# - task1_dataset_analysis_visualization.ipynb
# - task2_web_scraping_domain_analysis.ipynb
# - task3_ML.ipynb
```

Or use VS Code's Jupyter extension:
1. Install the **Jupyter** extension in VS Code
2. Open any `.ipynb` file
3. Select the Python kernel from your virtual environment
4. Run cells one by one

### Running the Streamlit Dashboards

```bash

## Notes

- Both notebooks include **synthetic data fallback** — if the dataset URL is unavailable, the notebooks will generate realistic synthetic data so you can still run all cells.
- The web scraping notebook requires an **internet connection** to access books.toscrape.com.
- All visualizations use **plotly** for interactivity when possible, with **matplotlib/seaborn** as backup.
- The Streamlit dashboards are **standalone** and generate their own data.
